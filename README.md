Hospital Emergency Room Analysis using Power BI

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze emergency room (ER) performance and patient flow.

Key analysis areas included:

Patient Admission Status – tracked admitted vs. non-admitted patients.

Patient Age Distribution – grouped patients into 10-year intervals for demographic insights.

Department Referrals – analyzed referral patterns across hospital departments.

Timeliness – measured percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes.

Gender & Racial Demographics – visualized patient distribution by gender and race.

Time Analysis – assessed patient volume trends by day and hour.

Built monthly and custom date-range views for trend analysis and holistic performance summaries.

Developed a granular patient-level view displaying key fields (Patient ID, Name, Gender, Age, Admission Date, Race, Wait Time, Department Referral, Admission Status) to support troubleshooting and detailed analysis.

Delivered actionable insights to improve ER efficiency, reduce wait times, and optimize staff scheduling.
